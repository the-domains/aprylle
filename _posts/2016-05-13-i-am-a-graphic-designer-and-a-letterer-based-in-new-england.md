I am a graphic designer and a letterer based in New England. I also work as a web designer/developer for [Leverett Media][0] in Boston.**Fun fact about me:**I like to hoard type-related things like patches, books, old posters, magazines, labels, etc. I'm a**_typomaniac;_** let's leave it at that.

Anyway, I am always on the lookout for opportunities to use my design skills, be it on the web, print, or both, so **[SAY HELLO][1]**and let's **COLLABORATE**.

**If you want to read a semi-lengthy version of my story, here is a brief history of who I am, where I came from, and why I do what I do:**I grew up in the Philippines and lived there for 15 years. However, a few months before I turned 16, I moved to the United States with my family.

The differences in culture were overwhelming at first. My camera was one of the things that kept me from missing home too much. With Maine's beautiful sceneries, it was fairly easy to find spots to photograph. Later on, art became my passion. I went to a local college to pursue an Associate's Degree in Graphic Design because the idea was to learn the Adobe programs while I teach myself photography. However, I didn't expect to fall in love with the degree I took almost out of whim.

My love for graphic design grew especially towards letters. It amazes me how a letter can serve as an illustration; that every tweak can make it dynamic and tell a story. I enjoy experimenting with different styles of lettering and calligraphy. When it comes websites, I consider them challenging yet fun. I always feel like a genius whenever I fix a broken code.

Many of the skills I have developed were thanks to self-initiated **[side-projects and client work][2]**. Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Graphic Web Design at Southern New Hampshire University while working freelancer.
